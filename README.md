# Circuit Sketch Recognition üëÅ

## About the App
The **Circuit Sketch Recognition** app demonstrates the power of AI to recognize hand-drawn circuit diagrams. By leveraging advanced models like TrOCR for text recognition and YOLOv8 for component detection, this app showcases how easily computers can understand sketches (Fine tuned on a CGHD-2304 dataset).

## Features
- **Upload or Capture**: Upload a picture of your circuit sketch or use your camera to capture one in real-time.
- **Dual Display**: View both capture and upload options in a side-by-side format for easy access.
- **Example Gallery**: Explore a gallery of recognized sketches to see the accuracy and capabilities of our AI models.
